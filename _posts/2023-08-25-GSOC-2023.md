My Google Summer of Code project was done under the Ste\|\|ar Group organisation. I was working on HPX, a C++ Standard Library for Concurrency and Parallelism. It implements all of the corresponding facilities as defined by the C++ Standard. 


# Project Description
Execution policies in C++ refer to a feature introduced in the C++17 standard that provides a standardized way to control the parallelism and concurrency of certain algorithms in the Standard Template Library (STL). These policies allow you to specify how certain algorithms should execute, either sequentially, in parallel or in an unsequenced fashion.

1. `std::execution::seq` : This policy specifies sequential execution. Algorithms executed with this policy will run serially in the order they appear, with no parallelism or concurrency.

2. `std::execution::par` : This policy allows algorithms to execute in parallel if deemed beneficial by the implementation. The exact level of parallelism is determined by the compiler and runtime, taking into account factors like the number of available processor cores and the size of the input data.

3. `std::execution::par_unseq`: This policy enables both parallel and vectorized execution. It is suitable for algorithms where the data can be processed in parallel and vectorized operations can be applied to individual elements. This policy aims to exploit SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) capabilities for performance gains.

4. `std::execution::unseq` <sup><sub>(since C++20)</sub></sup> : This policy enables vectorized execution. It is suitable for algorithms where vectorized operations can be applied to elements. This policy aims to exploit SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) capabilities for performance gains.

The project focused on implementing vectorization using openMP to optimise `std::execution::unseq` and `std::execution::par_unseq` execution

# Project Report



# <i>std::uninitialzed_*</i>

Algorithms like std::uninitialzed_copy, std::uninitialzed_move, etc., can be optimised for trivial types if the container stores the data contiguously in memory. Instead of using a usual for loop to copy each element individually, we can use std::memcopy or std::memove. This gives significant performance improvements.

# <i>Vectorizating loops with conditional break</i>
Loops with conditional loops can be vectorized by using simd reduction on a vector lane and breaking out if the reduction returns true

This allows us to vectorize STL algorithms like remove, find ...


```cpp
i=0
while(i<= n-LANE_SIZE){
    FlagTy flag = 0;

    /*
      check if any of the elements in a chunk
      evaluate predicate to 1.
      Flag set to true if that's the case
    */
    VECTOR_REDUCTION (|)
    for(j=i; j < i+LANE_SIZE; j++)
    {
        FlagTy t = pred(jth element);
        lane[j-1] = t;
        flag |= t;
    }


    /*
      If flag is set to true,
      check which element in the chunk
      evaluates to true
    */
    if(flag)
    {
        j=0;
        for(;j<LANE_SIZE;j++){
            if(pred(lane[j]))
                break;
        }
        return (i+j);
    }
    i+=LANE_SIZE
}


// evaluate the last couple elements
for(; i < n; j++)
{
    if(pred(jth element))
        return j;
}

return j;
``` 

LANE_SIZE is $$ \frac {\mathrm{size-of-simd-register}}{\mathrm{size-of-datatype}}$$ = number of elements which can fit in one simd register

Performance Improvements observed are as follows: 

![simd_helper](/assets/simd_helper.png)

Container is a vector where loop breaks at the $$ \frac{\mathrm{len}}{2} $$ element

Errorbars show the variance of meaesured data

Performance was measured against a simple for loop
```cpp
for(i=0; i<n; i++)
{ 
    if(pred(ith element))
        break;
}
```

We had observed that vectorization of the following loop is quite hard, often small changes such as changing Datatype of flag variable can lead to vectorization breaking for certain compilers and architectures.

Untill GCC 9, vectorization is enabled only in case of `int32_t` not for `int8_t`
in case of Clang it is the opposite, vectorization is enabled for only `int8_t` until Clang 14. [Godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/rronrG154) \
Testing performance on GCC 11 (vectorizes in both cases) has shown `int32_t` to be around 40% faster then `int8_t` (90 mus vs 53mus)

If vectorization does not occur this algorithm in 2 times slower then using a simple for loop, hence performance regression tests were added to make sure no breaking changes would be made in the future.
